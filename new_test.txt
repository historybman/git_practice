Here's a file that I'm going to edit and then commit later once it's done.  I first write some lines of text to get some changes in the file.  

Now I'm adding some new lines so that we can test the diff function and compare the two commits.  It's starting to all make more sense to me.  

I'm going to add even more lines now.  When I committed the last time, I think I removed the option to compare by diff.  We'll see if this works any better.
